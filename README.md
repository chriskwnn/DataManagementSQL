# DataManagementSQL
SQL queries and database creation for my data management course
The goal of the project is to create a database which can record purchase orders, sales, and employee performance efficiently. 
These goals are achieved by running the SQL queries
The database was created via PhPMyAdmin which you can install by downloading XAMMP.
To get a good understanding of the database we created check out the relational database diagram!

To run this:
1. Download XAMMP
2. Run the database creation and randomized data insertion file
3. Test the database by running the managerial questions

What I was responsible for:
1. Helping design the database relationships
2. Designing the managerial questions
3. Writing all of the SQL queries to answer the managerial questions
